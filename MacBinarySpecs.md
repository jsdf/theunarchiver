The following notes are a proposal for a standard format for binary transfer of arbitrary Macintosh documents via a telecommunication link. It is intended for use both between Macintoshes running (possibly different) terminal programs which adhere to the standard, and for use in uploading arbitrary Macintosh documents to remote systems (where it is presumed that they will be stored as an exact image of the data transmitted). A proposal is also made for standard processing to be performed on text files transferred via a protocol, to maximize the likelihood that text files transmitted to a remote system will be usable by that system, and that text files received from a remote system will be usable by the Macintosh.

It is recommended that the format and procedures described here be referred to as "MacBinary", and that any terminal program implementing this format and procedures be called "MacBinary-Compatible".

The binary format described is independent of the communication protocol used to accomplish the transfer, and assumes only that an 8-bit transparent transfer can be accomplished. Such protocols as Christensen (usually referred to as XMODEM or MODEM7), Kermit, and CompuServe A or B meet this requirement. Because of the proposed standard's MacTerminal/XMODEM heritage, there is a requirement that the transmitted data be padded (with nulls) to a 128-byte boundary at certain points, but this in no way implies that a block-oriented protocol must be used. The basic format proposed is identical to that used by MacTerminal, by Mike Boich and Martin Haeberli, and can be used with a version of MacTerminal that has had a patch applied to "normalize" its implementation of the XMODEM protocol.

In brief, the binary format consists of a 128-byte header containing all the information necessary to reproduce the document's directory entry on the receiving Macintosh; followed by the document's Data Fork (if it has one), padded with nulls to a multiple of 128 bytes (if necessary); followed by the document's Resource Fork (again, padded if necessary). The lengths of these forks (either or both of which may be zero) are contained in the header.


The format of the 128-byte header is as follows (offsets and lengths are given in decimal):

| **Offset** | **Length** | **Contents\*Â **|
|:-----------|:-----------|:|
| 000 | 1 | Zero. This is a "version" byte. |
| 001 | 1 | Length of filename. |
| 002 | 63 | Filename (only "length" bytes are significant) (the following 16 bytes are a standard Finder Info record) |
| 065 | 4 | File type. |
| 069 | 4 | File creator. |
| 073 | 1 | Finder flags: Bit 7 - Locked. Bit 6 - Invisible. Bit 5 - Bundle. Bit 4 - System. Bit 3 - Bozo. Bit 2 - Busy. Bit 1 - Changed. Bit 0 - Inited. |
| 074 | 1 | Zero. |
| 075 | 2 | File's vertical position within its window. |
| 077 | 2 | File's horizontal position within its window. |
| 079 | 2 | File's window or folder ID. (End of Finder Info) |
| 081 | 1 | "Protected" flag (in low order bit). |
| 082 | 1 | Zero. |
| 083 | 4 | Data Fork length (bytes, zero if no Data Fork). |
| 087 | 4 | Resource Fork lenth (bytes, zero if no R.F.). |
| 091 | 4 | File's creation date. |
| 095 | 4 | File's "last modified" date. |
| 099 | 27 | Zero fill (reserved for expansion of standard). |
| 126 | 2 | Reserved for computer type and OS ID (this field will be zero for the current Macintosh). |

Note that it is the responsibility of the receiving terminal program to resolve file name conflicts, generally by somehow modifying the name of received file if there already exists a file with the original name on the target volume.

Note also that, while the original window or folder ID and position may be transmitted, the receiving terminal program would not normally set these items for the received file, but would instead accept the values that the File Manager assigns when it creates the new file.

It is suggested that Macintosh terminal programs implement two modes of protocol transfer: text and document. Text mode is used for unformatted files of type TEXT (with only a data fork), and document mode (using the binary format proposed here) is used for all other files. Document mode may also be used on text files, of course, if it is desired to preserve such things as the file's creator ID or creation date.

The intent of text mode is to provide compatibility with text files on other systems. Toward that end, it is recommended that a linefeed be inserted after each return character as the text file is transmitted, and that, in the case of block-oriented protocols, the last block be explicitely padded with nulls if the text does not end on a block boundary. When receiving in text mode, linefeeds and trailing nulls should be stripped. If a CTRL-Z (Hex 1A) character is received following all other text (and before any null padding), it should also be stripped (Ctrl-Z is a common text terminator on CP/M and smoe other systems). Note that the above discussion applies only to text files transferred under some protocol, where an exact image of the transmitted data will be stored in a file on the remote system.

When receiving a file via a protocol, a terminal program may distinguish between text and document modes by examining bytes 0, 74, and 82 of the first 128 bytes received. If they are each zero (and at least 128 bytes have been received), then it is a safe assumption that a MacBinary-formatted document is being received. Terminal programs implementing possible future versions of the proposed standard would, of course, accept an appropriate set of version numbers in byte 0. Note also that compatible extensions of Version 0 of the proposed standard are possible (one such is suggested below) that involve transmission of additional information following the information described here. For this reason, a terminal program should be implemented so as to perform the proper receive procedures for all data sent to it, but to ignore any data that it does not know what to do with.

Since a text-mode document does not contain a file name, it is suggested that when text-mode is detected, a file be opened under a dummy name on the receiving Macintosh, the text written to that file, and the file renamed to a name selected by the user (via an SFPutFile box) after the reception is completed. This will avoid problems caused by indeterminate delays for name selection at the beginning of the file transfer.

It is desirable to allow the user to specify the destination volume in advance of the actual start of transfer for either type of transfer. Two methods are suggested for this: provide a "Select Destination Volume" menu selection, presumably in the menu containing the "Receive File" selection; or query the user immediately after the "Receive File" menu selection is made. Either or both of these methods could be implemented in a given terminal program - the independent "Select Receive Volume" method is particularly desirable if the ESC-a/ESC-b automatic receive facility (see below) is implemented. The volume selection procedure should provide the same functions as the volume selection portion of the SFGetFile and SFPutFile dialog boxes.


### First proposed extension to the proposed standard: ###

It is proposed that the binary format described above be extended to allow the transmission of descriptive text with a Macintosh document (specifically, the descriptive text from the Finder's "Get Info" box for the file being transferred). This is to be accomplished in a transparent manner by assigning bytes 99 and 100 of the header described above to be used to hold the length of the descriptive text (or zero, if there is none). The descriptive text, if any, will begin on the 128-boundary immediately following the Resource Fork, if present, else the Data Fork, if present, else immediately following the header if neither fork is present. It is hoped that methods for reading and setting a file's "Get Info" text will be made public at some point.


### Notes on MacTerminal's XMODEM implementation, and a proposed extension: ###

Familiarity with the Christensen (XMODEM) protocol is assumed in the following discussion.

When doing "Mac-to-Mac" transfers, using the binary format described above, unmodified MacTerminal does not use a true XMODEM protocol, and is therefore incompatible with most non-Mac systems. The differences lie in two specifics: the transmitting Macintosh initiates the transfer by sending the the two characters ESCAPE (hex 1B) and "a" (hex 61); the receiving Macintosh is expected to reply with the character ACK (hex 06). The transfer then proceeds using normal XMODEM procedures, except that each of the header and the two forks (if present) is treated as a separate XMODEM transfer, with the transmitting Macintosh waiting for a NAK (hex 15), then sending the blocks of that phase (beginning with a block number of one), then sending EOT (hex 04) and waiting for an ACK (hex 06) from the receiving Macintosh.

It is proposed that a modified procedure be accepted as a standard, to be implemented instead of or in addition to the above-described MacTerminal "Mac-to-Mac" protocol in complying terminal programs. The modified procedure, which is compatible with standard XMODEM implementations, functions as follows: The transmitting Macintosh sends the two characters ESCAPE (hex 1B) and "b" (hex 62). The receiving Macintosh may optionally reply with ACK (hex 06) (this is allowed so as to have minimum impact on existing MacTerminal-compatible implementations). The transmitting Macintosh then awaits receipt of a NAK (hex 15) (or optionally a "C" (hex 43), if the receiving terminal program supports CRC checking), following which a single, normal XMODEM transfer occurs. The transfer may be in text mode or document mode, will begin with block number one, and block numbers will increment uniformly (modulo 256) throughout the transfer.

It is expected that a patch to MacTerminal making it compatible with the above proposed procedure will be available in the near future.

# MacBinary II #

## Macintosh Binary Transfer Format ("MacBinary II") Standard Proposal ##

_These are the new changes to the MacBinary Standard, as generally agreed upon in the MacBinary II Conference 6/21/87, and as changed in the followup conference 6/28/87. Revised 7/24/87 to reflect suggestions and clarifications that came later, and to include all necessary information needed from the original MacBinary standard document to implement MacBinary II._


The new standard will be very similar to the original MacBinary standard as described in [Standard](MacBinary.md). (Reading the original standard is recommended for a full understanding of implementation and philosophy behind the MacBinary I and II formats.) The binary format consists of a 128-byte header containing all the information necessary to reproduce the document's directory entry on the receiving Macintosh; followed by the document's Data Fork (if it has one), padded with nulls to a multiple of 128 bytes (if necessary); followed by the document's Resource Fork (again, padded if necessary). The lengths of these forks (either or both of which may be zero) are contained in the header.


The format of the header for MacBinary II is as follows:

| **Offset** | **Length** | **Contents** |
|:-----------|:-----------|:-------------|
| 000 | Byte | old version number, must be kept at zero for compatibility |
| 001 | Byte | Length of filename (must be in the range 1-63) |
| 002 | 1 to 63 Bytes | filename (only "length" bytes are significant). |
| 065 | Long Word | file type (normally expressed as four characters) |
| 069 | Long Word | file creator (normally expressed as four characters) |
| 073 | Byte | original Finder flags: Bit 7 - Locked.  Bit 6 - Invisible. Bit 5 - Bundle. Bit 4 - System. Bit 3 - Bozo. Bit 2 - Busy. Bit 1 - Changed. Bit 0 - Inited. |
| 074 | Byte | zero fill, must be zero for compatibility |
| 075 | Word | file's vertical position within its window. |
| 077 | Word | file's horizontal position within its window. |
| 079 | Word | file's window or folder ID. |
| 081 | Byte | "Protected" flag (in low order bit). |
| 082 | Byte | zero fill, must be zero for compatibility |
| 083 | Long Word | Data Fork length (bytes, zero if no Data Fork). |
| 087 | Long Word | Resource Fork length (bytes, zero if no R.F.). |
| 091 | Long Word | File's creation date |
| 095 | Long Word | File's "last modified" date. |
| 099 | Word | length of Get Info comment to be sent after the resource fork (if implemented, see below). |
| `*`101 | Byte | Finder Flags, bits 0-7. (Bits 8-15 are already in byte 73) |
| `*`116 | Long Word | Length of total files when packed files are unpacked. This is only used by programs that pack and unpack on the fly, mimicing a standalone utility such as PackIt. A program that is uploading a single file must zero this location when sending a file. Programs that do not unpack/uncompress files when downloading may ignore this value. |
| `*`120 | Word | Length of a secondary header. If this is non-zero, skip this many bytes (rounded up to the next multiple of 128). This is for future expansion only, when sending files with MacBinary, this word should be zero. |
| `*`122 | Byte | Version number of Macbinary II that the uploading program is written for (the version begins at 129) |
| `*`123 | Byte | Minimum MacBinary II version needed to read this file (start this value at 129 |
| `*`124 | Word | CRC of previous 124 bytes |

`*` This is newly defined for MacBinary II.

All values are stored in normal 68000 order, with Most Significant Byte appearing first then the file. Any bytes in the header not defined above should be set to zero.

The original MacBinary format was ammended to include the sending of the FCMT (Get Info comment) after the resource fork was sent, if the length for such comment, given in offset 99, is not zero. To the best of our knowledge, no program has implemented this feature, due to Apple's stated position that no program should read or write these comments. The definition remains in MacBinary II, so that should Apple ever provide a documented way of reading and writing these comments, terminal programs will be able to take advantage of this feature.

All Finder flags and information would be uploaded, however, a downloading program should clear the Finder flag bits of

0 - Set if file/folder is on the desktop (Finder 5.0 and later)

1 - bFOwnAppl (used internally)

8 - Inited (seen by Finder)

9 - Changed (used internally by Finder)

10 - Busy (copied from File System busy bit)

Also, fdLocation and fdFldr should be zeroed

To determine if a header is a valid MacBinary header, check bytes 0 and 74 to be both zero. If they are both zero, either (a) the CRC should match, which means it is a MB II file, or (b) byte 82 is zero, which means it may be a MB I file. (Note that, at the current version level, byte 82 is kept zero to maintain compatibility with MacBinary I. If at some point the MacBinary versions change sufficiently that it is necessary to keep MacBinary I programs from downloading these files, we can change byte 82 to non-zero.)

If the header is a MB II header, the program will check the minimum version byte, to see if it knows enough to decode the file. If the minimum version in the header is greater than the version that the terminal program was written for, it will download the file as pure XModem (creating a "TEXT" file) and notify the user that conversion is needed because the MacBinary version was too high.

If the header does NOT represent a valid MB II header, the program must at minimum check byte 82 to be zero--if it is not zero, the file is not a MB I file. It is possible to write a much more robust routine, by checking the following:

Offsets 101-125, Byte, should all be 0.

Offset 2, Byte, (the length of the file name) should be in the range of 1-63.

Offsets 83 and 87, Long Word, (the length of the forks) should be in the range of 0-$007F FFFF.

If any of these tests fail, the file is not a valid MacBinary file. It may still be desirable to distinguish between text files and foreign binary files (for stripping line feeds or similar helpful acts). Some tests that would prove useful include:

A quantity of bytes in the first block with the high bit set would point to a binary file (though this could be fooled by files with many extended ascii characters, such as generated by the option key on a Mac).

A large quantity of zero bytes (nulls) would also point to a binary file.


This proposal was adopted at two conferences attended by representatives from CompuServe, Delphi and BIX networks, and many terminal software publishers.

# MacBinary III #


## Macintosh Binary Transfer Format ("MacBinary III") Standard Proposal ##

**These are the new changes to the MacBinary Standard, as generally agreed upon in December of 1996. This document includes all necessary information needed from the original MacBinary and MacBinary II standard documents to implement MacBinary III.**


The new standard will be very similar to the MacBinary II standard as described in [II Standard](MacBinary.md). (Reading the original MacBinary and MacBinary II standard documents are recommended for a full understanding of implementation and philosophy behind the MacBinary I, II and III formats.)

The binary format consists of a 128-byte header containing all the information necessary to reproduce the document's directory entry on the receiving Macintosh; followed by the document's Data Fork (if it has one), padded with nulls to a multiple of 128 bytes (if necessary); followed by the document's Resource Fork (again, padded if necessary). The lengths of these forks (either or both of which may be zero) are contained in the header.


The format of the header for MacBinary III is as follows:

| **Offset** | **Length** | **Contents** |
|:-----------|:-----------|:-------------|
| 000 | Byte | old version number, must be kept at zero for compatibility |
| 001 | Byte | Length of filename (must be in the range 1-31) |
| 002 | 1 to 63 Bytes | filename (only "length" bytes are significant). |
| 065 | Long Word | file type (normally expressed as four characters) |
| 069 | Long Word | file creator (normally expressed as four characters) |
| 073 | Byte | original Finder flags: Bit 7 - isAlias. Bit 6 - isInvisible. Bit 5 - hasBundle. Bit 4 - nameLocked. Bit 3 - isStationery. Bit 2 - hasCustomIcon. Bit 1 - reserved. Bit 0 - hasBeenInited. |
| 074 | Byte | zero fill, must be zero for compatibility |
| 075 | Word | file's vertical position within its window. |
| 077 | Word | file's horizontal position within its window. |
| 079 | Word | file's window or folder ID. |
| 081 | Byte | "Protected" flag (in low order bit). |
| 082 | Byte | zero fill, must be zero for compatibility |
| 083 | Long Word | Data Fork length (bytes, zero if no Data Fork). |
| 087 | Long Word | Resource Fork length (bytes, zero if no R.F.). |
| 091 | Long Word | File's creation date |
| 095 | Long Word | File's "last modified" date. |
| 099 | Word | length of Get Info comment to be sent after the resource fork (if implemented, see below). |
| 101 | Byte | Finder Flags, bits 0-7. (Bits 8-15 are already in byte 73)  Bit 7 - hasNoInits Bit 6 - isShared Bit 5 - requiresSwitchLaunch Bit 4 - ColorReserved Bits 1-3 - color Bit 0 - isOnDesk |
| `*`102 | Long Word | signature for indentification purposes ('mBIN') |
| `*`106 | Byte | script of file name (from the fdScript field of an fxInfo record) |
| `*`107 | Byte | extended Finder flags (from the fdXFlags field of an fxInfo record) |
| 108-115 |  | Unused (must be zeroed by creators, must be ignored by readers) |
| 116 | Long Word | Length of total files when packed files are unpacked. As of the writing of this document, this field has never been used. |
| 120 | Word | Length of a secondary header. If this is non-zero, skip this many bytes (rounded up to the next multiple of 128). This is for future expansion only, when sending files with MacBinary, this word should be zero. |
| `*`122 | Byte | Version number of MacBinary III that the uploading program is written for (the version is 130 for MacBinary III) |
| 123 | Byte | Minimum MacBinary version needed to read this file (set this value at 129 for backwards compatibility with MacBinary II) |
| 124 | Word | CRC of previous 124 bytes |

`*` These fields have changed for MacBinary III.

All values are stored in normal 68000 order, with Most Significant Byte appearing first then the file. Any bytes in the header not defined above should be set to zero.

The original MacBinary format was ammended (in MacBinary II) to include the sending of the "Get Info comment" after the resource fork was sent, if the length for such comment, given in offset 99, is not zero. Prior to the release of System 7, there was no approved API for access to this information and so most existing implemenations of MacBinary II will not include this. However you may find some modern implemenations of MacBinary II which do include it now that it is possible to do so. Although not required, it is recommend that MacBinary III supporting applications read and write this information.

To determine if a header is a valid MacBinary header, first take advantage of the new MacBinary III signature located at offset 102. If it matches, then you know that this is a valid MacBinary III header and can continue as such including the restoration of the new extended Finder info.

If it is not a MacBinary III header, start by checking bytes 0 and 74 - they should both be zero. If they are both zero, either (a) the CRC should match, which means it is a MacBinary II file, or (b) byte 82 is zero, which means it may be a MacBinary I file. (Note that, at the current version level, byte 82 is kept zero to maintain compatibility with MacBinary I. If at some point the MacBinary versions change sufficiently that it is necessary to keep MacBinary I programs from downloading these files, we can change byte 82 to non-zero.)

If the header is a MacBinary II header, the program will check the minimum version byte (offset 123), to see if it knows enough to decode the file. If the minimum version in the header is greater than the version that the program was written for, it will download the file as raw binary. The program may also choose to notify the user that conversion is needed because the MacBinary version was too high.

If the header does NOT represent a valid MacBinary II header, the program must at minimum check byte 82 to be zero--if it is not zero, the file is not a MacBinary I file. It is possible to write a much more robust routine, by checking the following:

Offsets 101-125, Byte, should all be 0.

Offset 2, Byte, (the length of the file name) should be in the range of 1-63.

Offsets 83 and 87, Long Word, (the length of the forks) should be in the range of 0-$007F FFFF.

If any of these tests fail, the file is not a valid MacBinary file. It may still be desirable to distinguish between text files and foreign binary files (for stripping line feeds or similar helpful acts). Some tests that would prove useful include:

A quantity of bytes in the first block with the high bit set would point to a binary file (though this could be fooled by files with many extended ascii characters, such as generated by the option key on a Mac).

A large quantity of zero bytes (nulls) would also point to a binary file.

In November of 1996, Apple made it known to developers that a version of Finder due out in 1997 would begin using the extended Finder information (FXInfo - additional Finder related information originally introduced with the Hierarchical File System (HFS) in System 3.0/Finder 5.0 but not actually used to any extent until now). These changes are indeed present in Finder 8.0, which is part of Mac OS 8 (code named "Tempo").

This proposal was drafted by as a result of a series of EMail discussions concerning the need for a Macintosh binary transfer format that stores the extended Finder information. The group decided that rather than creating a new format, or adopting another exsting format that users were unfamiliar with and that wasn't as well supported by application developers (such as AppleSingle), that a simple (backwards compatible) change to the existing MacBinary II specification would suffice.
