# Introduction #

StuffIt X contains an algorithm for re-compressing JPEG image more efficiently by using the SitxRangeCoder. This algorithm is extremely complex and has not been reverse-engineered. Any information about this algorithm would be highly appreciated.

Apparently the algorithm is patented, or patent-pending, but no information about the patent in question has been found, either.
