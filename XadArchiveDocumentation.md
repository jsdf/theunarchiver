# Introduction #

XADArchive implements the older high-level API in XADMaster.framework.

Unfortunately, this documentation has not been written yet, so the only information available is in the [XADArchive.h header file](http://code.google.com/p/theunarchiver/source/browse/trunk/XADMaster/XADArchive.h).
