# Supported popular formats #

|:-------|:--------------|:------|
| Zip | Full | Full support for the normal zip format, with additional support for AES encryption, Zip64 extensions for large files, Mac OS extensions of many different kinds, and several unusual compression methods (Deflate64, Bzip, LZMA, PPMd). Can also extract .EXE self-extracting files using Zip. |
| RAR | Full | Including encryption and multiple volumes. Can also extract .EXE self-extracting files using RAR. |

| EXE | Some | Many kinds of .exe self-extracting formats are supported. However, if you find one that is not, please post an issue on the bug tracker. |

# Unsupported formats, for which support would be good to have #

| Format | Notes | Issue number |
|:-------|:------|:-------------|
| Ace 2.0 | Proprietary, requires reverse engineering. | [58](http://code.google.com/p/theunarchiver/issues/detail?id=58) |
| StuffIt X JPEG | Propietary, hugely complicated algorithm. Would require lots of reverse engineering. Supposedly patented, but I have been unable to locate the patent (which would contain useful information about the format). | [146](http://code.google.com/p/theunarchiver/issues/detail?id=146) |
| DMG | Mac OS X disk images with a HFS+ filesystem. |  |
| PAR | Not an archive format, but recovery records for missing archive parts. | [39](http://code.google.com/p/theunarchiver/issues/detail?id=39) |
| SHK | Apple II archive format. | [119](http://code.google.com/p/theunarchiver/issues/detail?id=119) |
| Amiga compressors | The Amiga had a lot of different single-file compressors. Support for more of these would be useful. libxfd supports many of them, but is mostly 68k only. |  |
| Deb | Linux package format. |  |
